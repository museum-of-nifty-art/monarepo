# :wrench: :construction: MoNA's Smart Contracts.

&nbsp;

This repo is to demonstrate how you would set up the MoNA smart-contract development environment using HardHat to do most of the heavy lifting for you. Head on over to the `./test` folder to examine the javascript files that thoroughly test the smart-contract, which latter you will find in `./contracts`.
